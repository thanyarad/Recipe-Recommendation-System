## Features
- User authentication (Login/Signup)
- Generate new recipes using AI
- View and manage recipe history
- Responsive and user-friendly design

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React (or Vue.js)
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **API Integration**: Anthropic Claude API

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/recipe-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd recipe-app
   ```
3. Install dependencies for both front-end and back-end:
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables (e.g., database connection string, API keys).

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage
- **Login/Signup**: Users can create an account or log in to access personalized features.
- **Generate Recipes**: Users can generate new recipes based on their preferences.
- **View History**: Users can view their previously generated recipes and manage their history.

## System Architecture

### Front-end
The front-end of the application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using frameworks like React or Vue.js for efficient development. The main components include:
- **Login Page**: For user authentication
- **Signup Page**: For new user registration
- **Main Page**: Displays the main functionalities and options
- **History/Home Page**: Shows previously generated recipes
- **Generate New**: Allows users to generate new recipes

### Back-end
The back-end is built using Node.js and Express.js, handling the business logic and API calls. It includes:
- **API Calls**: To communicate with the front-end and external APIs
- **Database Management**: MongoDB for storing user data and recipes

## Models and Views

### Data Collection and Summary
Data is collected from user inputs and external APIs, then summarized for further processing.

### Data Preprocessing
Data is cleaned and transformed to make it suitable for model training and prediction.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the AI models used for recipe generation is evaluated using metrics like accuracy.
